Status : Not finished yet

### Total-perspective-vortex

Total-perspective-vortex is an advanced project in the algorithmic/artificial intelligence branch at 42 Paris.
The goal of this project is to learn how to parse, analyze and predict from the raw data of MNE and EGG.
Thanks to this data, we are able to predict, using the brain scan of subjects, if a subject is either going to move his hand or his feet.

## Running the project
